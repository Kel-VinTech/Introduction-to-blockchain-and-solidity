--<h3>what is blockchain</h3>

Imagine a tree with its main root stuck in the ground, having multiple branches and leaves. each branch represents a block and each leaf represent a transaction.
A branch is an extension connected to the a tree, having collection of leaves bundle together [a block is a collection of transactions bundle together]. the block stores a reference to the previous block [a branch of a tree is a subdivision of the root tree, that are linked together in a specific order] forming a chain-like structure.   

similar to how a tree distributes nutrients to its branches and leaves[blockchain distributes data across a network]. Each node in the network has a copy of the entire blockchain making it decentralized and resistant to single-point of failure. "single-point of failure is a part of a system, that if it fails, will affect the entire system"

Gathering and processing the above information, A blockchain is define as distributed ledger consisting of data blocks that is shared among a computer's network node.

--<h3>Purpose of Blockchain</h3>
Blockchain runs on a decentrazlied system, meaning controls and decision-making is transferred from centralized to distrubuted network. The following are the advantage and purpose of Blockchain

immutability <br>
Security <br>
Trust <br>
Transparency <br>

<h3>How blockchain works</h3>
